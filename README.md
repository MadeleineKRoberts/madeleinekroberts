## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Madeleine Roberts! I'm a data analyst and software engineer with a passion for using data and techology to solve complex problems. By day, I work as a football data analyst for the Green Bay Packers, leveraging data to drive performance insights. Outside of work, I apply my analytical skills to my own athletic pursuitsâ€”aiming to run a sub-3:20 marathon in 2025â€”and contribute to my community through data consulting for local political campaigns. I also enjoy sharing the tools and techniques I develop along the way to empower others.   

I believe that data and technology have the power to change the world, making it a better, happier, and healthier place, and I strive to help make that a reality.

## Current Projects:  
- **[NYC Jobs(Sorted!) (2025)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/marathon_training_analysis)**: Frustrated by the inablity to sort the City of New York Job Board by posting date, I decided to used their API to create a version that could. While the application currently meets my use cases (ablity to search by job title and sort by the jobs that were most recently updated), I hope to continue to tweak the app for more efficient and advanced sorting and searching, as well as potentially host a more polished, accessible verison to help other people in their job hunt.
  
- **[Marathon Training Analysis (2024)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/marathon_training_analysis)**: Using Strava's API, I am analyzing data from my last three marathon training plans and off-season periods to evaluate their impact on my performance in my upcoming marathon on May 18. This analysis involves methods such as time-series analysis, correlation studies, and regression modeling to identify patterns, relationships, and key predictors of race-day outcomes. Additionally, the analysis includes my return-to-play journey after breaking my ankle in January 2023 to completing the Chicago Marathon in October 2023.

## Previous Projects:
- **[New Arrivals Chicago (2024)](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/new-arrivals-chi)**: A digital resource guide to help newly arrived individuals navigate the Chicago and access available resources. Recognizing the challenges migrants face in understanding and utilizing essential services, our goal is to provide accurate, up-to-date, and actionable information. The public-facing site includes guides for getting started in Chicago, legal support, and health resources, along with a two-tiered login system for organizations to update their information and site administrators to manage all content. This student-run project, developed in collaboration with community-based organizations, is a work in progress, with plans to expand its services in the future.

- **[Portland Rank Choice Voting Simulation (2024)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/Portland-RCV)**: In collaboration with Moon Duchin and the MGGG Redistricting Lab, this study investigates the influence of Portland's new proportional rank choice voting system on its 2024 city council elections, using simulations to analyze voter behavior across different demographic and ideological groups. Utilizing [MGGG's Votekit Package](https://github.com/mggg/VoteKit), it offers strategic insights for campaigns and the election of POC candidates. (Codebase not publically available) 

- **[Traffic Analysis and Forecasting (2024)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/traffic_time_series)**: Applies time series models like SARIMA, Regression with ARIMA Errors, and STL with multiple seasonal periods to analyze and predict traffic patterns by capturing seasonal trends, linear relationships, and complex seasonal variations.

- **[Campaign Donation Analyzer (2023)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/FEC_Big_Data_Analysis)**: This simple web app allows users to investigate and create their own summaries of all FEC campaign donations dating back to the 2020 (6GB of data), with filtering options for candidate, candidate's state, candidate's party, donor state, and donor's party. The app utilizes Apache Kafka to stream-process real-time data, ensuring up-to-date insights. It also applies MapReduce for batch processing calculations, enabling efficient handling of large datasets. Built on Lambda Architecture principles, the app leverages Apache's tech stack, including HDFS, Hadoop, Hive, and Spark, to manage large-scale data processing, enabling both real-time and batch analytics for in-depth campaign donation analysis.
  
- **[Genomics Annotations Service (2023)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/cloud_based_application)**: Developed a cloud-based genomics annotation platform on AWS. The application uses Flask to build an API for user-differentiated access and integrates distributed, load-balanced EC2 infrastructure with DynamoDB to manage job persistence and state tracking. AWS S3 is used for object storage, while Free user data is archived in AWS Glacier and restored upon upgrading to Premium. SQS and SNS enable asynchronous operations, improving system scalability and availability. The platform includes a relational database for user account management, a key-value store for annotation job metadata, and a web application for user interaction. Features include Globus Auth login, job submission, notifications, result downloads, and a Premium upgrade option for persistent data access. AnnTools powers the annotation services. The repository is private, but can be shared upon request. A diagram of the final components and interactions can be seen [here](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/madeleinekroberts/blob/main/references/GAS_diagram.png).

- **[Sentiment of Local Newspaper Coverage on the 2023 Primary Election's Mayoral Candidates in Chicago (2023)](https://github.com/uchicago-mscapp-projects/databased_project)**: Examining the Scope and Sentiment of Local Newspaper Coverage on the 2023 Primary Election's Mayoral Candidates in Chicago. [*Read more here*](https://github.com/uchicago-mscapp-projects/databased_project/blob/ec9233f17a1cf63b676e113b3484415c2df6aad5/proj-paper.pdf)

- **[2023 U.S. Senate Midterm Election Model (2023)](https://github.com/MadeleineKRoberts/2022_midterms_senate_prediction)**: Implemented a simple predictive model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to forecast the outcomes of the 2022 U.S. Senate elections, with numerical predictions summarized as the two-party vote share for each state. The accompanying paper provides a detailed explanation and justification of the methodology and assumptions used in making the predictions. [This work was featured in the University of Chicago's public policy newspaper](https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/prognosticators-harris-class-attempts-predict-2022-midterm-election-results), where I created the most accurate prediction of my class based on the two-party vote share.
